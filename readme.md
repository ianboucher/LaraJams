What is Bloc-jams?
------------------
Bloc Jams is a single-page music player application which features interactive scroll bars, volume controls and playlists using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Sass on the front-end and Laravel on the backend.

How does it work?
-----------------
From the landing page, you can sign-up or sign-in using the links in the navigation bar, or simply go straight to the album collection.

Click on an album cover to view the album tracks and select one to play. There are play, pause and skip controls in the player bar at the bottom of the screen where you can also scrub the track and volume with the seek-bar.

You can create and edit your own playlists where you can add and remove your favorite (as long as your favorite tracks are by Faker McFake!).
